# Plant Journal in JavaScript

Descripton: This is my first completely original idea for a JavaScript project. I have a real need to track information concerning my indoor and outdoor plants, so I hope that this program will actually help me with my plant care and documentation.

## Overview

I am starting off very small with what I have learned so far in JavaScript.  I will continue to develop this project as I learn more.  Also, I hope that this project will be the beginnings of a much larger project--a personal journal web app--to track, in addition to my plants, my health, finances, home maintenance, and hair care.

The plant tracker will store information about the plant. For the indoor plants, I would want to store info about name, age, source, care requirements, dates watered, dates fertilized, growth, repottings, cuttings, pests, diseases, damage, and death.  For the outdoor perennial plants, I would want to keep track of, in addition to all of the above, date sprouted, date bloomed, relocations rather than repottings.

I would like the user to be able to retrieve, add, and delete information as needed.
